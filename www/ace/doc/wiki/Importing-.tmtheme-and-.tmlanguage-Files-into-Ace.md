ACE supports the importing of *.tmtheme* and *.tmlanguage* files for use
in the editor. The task is accomplished by two simple node scripts.

Importing Textmate/Sublime Themes
-------------------------

1.  Go to the *tool* folder, and run `npm install` to install required
    dependencies.
2.  Drop your *.tmtheme* file into the *tmthemes folder*.
3.  Update the [tmtheme.js](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/blob/master/tool/tmtheme.js#L180) file to include your new theme.
4.  Run `node tmtheme.js`

Your *.tmtheme* will be converted and placed into *lib/ace/theme*
alongside other themes. Note that there’s one more class we’ve added
that isn’t available in regular Textmate themes, and that’s for
`.ace_indent-guide`. This class adds indentation guides for your theme,
using a base64-encoded png. In general, the dark themes and light themes
each have their own strings, so you can just copy the class from an
equivalent theme.

Importing Textmate/Sublime Languages
----------------------------

If you’re interested in porting over an existing *.tmlanguage* file into
Ace’s mode syntax highlighting, there’s a tool to accomplish that, too.

1.  Go to the *tool* folder. Run `npm install` to install required
    dependencies.
2.  Drop your *.tmlanguage* file into the tools folder.
3.  Run `node tmlanguage.js <path_to_tmlanguage_file>`, such as
    `node tmlanguage.js MyGreatLanguage.tmlanguage`.

Your *.tmlanguage* file will be converted to the best of the converter’s
ability. It is an understatement to say that the tool is imperfect.
Probably, this will never be able to be fully autogenerated. In
*.tmlanguage* files, for instance, one sees the use of
lookbehinds/negative lookbehinds, which JavaScript regexps simply do not
have. There’s a list of other non-determinable items, too:

-   Deciding which state to transition to  
     While the tool does create new states correctly, it labels them
    with generic terms like `state_2`, `state_10` _e.t.c._
-   Extending modes  
     Many modes say something like `include source.c`, to mean, “add all
    the rules in C highlighting.” That syntax does not make sense to Ace
    or this tool
-   Rule preference order
-   Gathering keywords  
     Most likely, you’ll need to take keywords from your language file
    and run them through `createKeywordMapper()`

Two files are created and placed in *lib/ace/mode*: one for the language
mode, and one for the set of highlight rules. You will still need to add
the code into _kitchen_sink.html_ and _demo.js_, as well as write any
tests for the highlighting.
